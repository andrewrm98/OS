Steps to Implement Project 3

Hints:

	COMPILE WITH -Wall and -pthread for gcc
	Mutex lock for managing data structures
	Semaphore or condition variable for waiting for access to the bathroom
	pthread_join
	assert that at least one of the man/woman counters is 0


Files needed:
	module "bathroom.o" - defines the bathroom
	interface file "bathroom.h" - must define interface to bathroom; Initialize, Finalize, Enter(), Leave()
	main() - bathroomSim
	Individual() - set the thread information
	Enter() and Leave()

Bathroom.h file:

	Enter(gender G) 
		- check for gender flag
		- enter if vacant or same gender
		- increment people in bathroom
		- wait if not

	Leave(void)
		- decrement the people in bathroom
		- set flag to vacant if last person

	Global bathroom object (PROTECT FROM RACE CONDITIONS)
		- counter for people in bathroom (both men and women)
		- gender flag or vacant
		- use synchronization primitives
		- holds poeple in bathroom
		- holds bathroom flag
		- # of usages of bathroom
		- total time bathroom vacant
		- total time occupied
		- average queue length
		- Average # of people in the bathroom at the same time

	Initialize(...)
		- called by master thread only

	Finalize(...)
		- after all threads have been called
		- print out statistics gathered by global bathroom object

bathroomSim - Main() - master thread:

	takes in - bathroomSim nUsers meanLoopCount meanArrival meanStay
	use Box-Muller transform to create random numvers with a normal distribution
	
	Calls Initialize
	Uses pthread_create to create all threads
	Waits until all threads have finished
	Calls finalized

	Individual(Gender, arrival time, time to stay, loop count) - used to implement the threads
		Gender - defined by random variable
		loop count - random based on the mean specified by the command line
		arrival and stay - random
			sleeps until arrival time
			invoke enter() - may have to wait a long time
			sleeps stay amount of time
			invokes leave
			repeat loop time amount of times
			each thread keeps track of how long it is in the bathroom
			after exiting thread prints:
				Its own thread number
				Its gender and number of loops
				The min average and max time spent in the queue

Problems:
	How do the threads inform the master they have finished
	How do user threads and master thread exit cleanly?
	Protect against threads printing out at the same time
